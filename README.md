These are the .STL files for a 3D printable stop-motion puppet that you can make at home!

### Requirements & What to expect
These files in their current form produce an approximately 4 inch tall puppet. You can go taller but the proportions begin to make less sense. Of course, the files are infinitely modifiable by you.

I have designed these to work around a certain size square plastic or brass tube (I do not remember the size right now so I will update this when I find it). These can often be purchased at hobby stores. I then put twisted aluminum wire into the tubes and use 2 part epoxy to make it stay. I slide the tubed-wire limbs into the holes to connect the parts of the puppet. On occasion, depending on how nice my printer is being, I will have to carve out the hole a bit on the puppet parts with a tiny drill bit to make it fit. But usually it's okay. They're all the same size so it's just printer calibration, really. And how you slice the parts.

### Skeleton
The skeleton folder contains files for the skeleton of my puppet. I typically print this with FDM printing for its lightness and flexibility of dimensions. I find that resin printing makes it difficult to make parts fit together well, due to warping.

### Head, Arms, Feet, etc.
Most other parts I typically resin print using [Siraya Tech Fast](https://siraya.tech/products/fast-abs-like?variant=40080399990893), typically in Cream for light flesh tones. I have painted / dyed them with Alcohol Ink in the past, though and it works well. Sharpie markers and Copic markers work well for details too! But the point is that the files are available for you.
